This repository contains a collection of React components to enable developers to integrate content filters and settings in content review tools.

## Content Review Filters Features

### Image & Video Filters

| Filter                        | Description                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Blur**                      | Applies a configurable blur effect to obscure fine details while maintaining general shapes and context            |
| **Grayscale (Black & White)** | Removes color information, which can reduce the visceral impact of graphic content                                 |
| **Sepia**                     | Applies a yellow/brown tint that creates visual distance by making content appear aged or historical               |
| **Transparency**              | Reduces opacity to make content less visually prominent while still allowing review                                |
| **Reduced Detail**            | Uses WebGL shaders to stylize content as an illustration, significantly reducing photorealism                      |
| **Warning Screen**            | Displays an interstitial warning before showing content predicted to be graphic, requiring explicit opt-in to view |

All filters are independently configurable with adjustable intensity levels (where applicable) and can be combined for cumulative effect.

### Video Playback Controls

Special playback features for video content to give reviewers more control:

| Feature            | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Playback Speed** | Adjustable default playback speed (e.g., 1.5x, 2x) to review content faster |
| **Jump Forward**   | Skip ahead by a configurable number of seconds                              |
| **Jump Backward**  | Skip back by a configurable number of seconds                               |
| **Auto Mute**      | Automatically mute audio when videos start playing                          |

### Per-Harm-Type Preferences

Filters can be configured differently based on content harm types. For example:

- **Default content**: Light blur + grayscale
- **Graphic content**: Full warning screen with explicit opt-in required

### Persistent Settings

User preferences are stored in browser localStorage by default, so settings persist across sessions. For cross-device persistence, preferences can be synced with a server-side database.

### Interactive Filter Controls

When enabled, a control bar appears on hover allowing reviewers to adjust filters for individual pieces of media in real-time.

## Technical Notes

### Reduced Detail Filter

The reduced detail filter uses WebGL to apply shaders to images or videos to make them appear as an illustration.

The WebGL context is created the first time a media actually asks for reduced
detail, not when the package is imported. An app that only uses the CSS based
filters never creates one, and importing the package works in environments
without WebGL2 or `OffscreenCanvas` - a test runner using jsdom, for example.

When reduced detail is requested and the environment cannot provide WebGL2, the
filter degrades instead of throwing: the media stays covered rather than being
shown in full detail, the other filters keep working, and the package reports
it once. Pass `onReducedDetailUnavailable` to either provider to react to it,
for instance by turning on the warning screen:

```jsx
<ContentReviewFilterGlobalPreferencesProvider
  initialPreferences={preferences}
  onReducedDetailUnavailable={() => setShowWarningScreen(true)}>
  {children}
</ContentReviewFilterGlobalPreferencesProvider>
```

`ContentReviewFilterSingleMediaContextProvider` accepts the same prop, for apps
that compose the wrapper components themselves. The innermost provider wins.

### Warning Screen Integration

The warning screen filter requires integration of your own AI model for content detection - you can build your own model, write a prompt for an LLM, or use an off-the-shelf solution from Trust & Safety or image recognition/Content Understanding AI vendors.

## Integration Options

There are multiple ways of integrating these components into your own tool, depending on how much customization you would like:

- Option A (easiest, least customizable): use provided `ContentFilteredImage` and `ContentFilteredVideo` components to render your image/video, with out-of-the box controls.
- Option B (harder, more customizable): use `ContentFilteredImageWrapper` and `ContentFilteredVideoWrapper` to wrap an HTML `img` or `video` tag within your own custom image viewer or video player. Use `ContentFilterContextProvider` to write the state of each filter (enabled/disabled), which will then be read by the aforementioned wrapper components to apply the filters. We provide each control button from Option A as a separate component, allowing you to arrange these as you need or to override styles and icons to fit the theme of your application.

The library also includes an example settings menu component for users to configure global preferences.

While this repository only contains React implementations of these filters, we welcome contributions of equivalent components for other web frameworks. We also welcome other contributions to continue to improve these tools.

## Security Considerations

When integrating these content review filters into production systems, please keep the following security considerations in mind:

### AI Model Integration and Content Detection

If you're using the warning screen filter with AI-based content detection:

- **Validate AI Model Outputs**: Always validate and sanitize outputs from AI models before using them to generate warnings or labels. AI models can produce unexpected or malicious outputs.
- **Human Oversight is Critical**: Do not rely solely on AI predictions for content moderation. AI models have limitations and can produce false positives and false negatives. Implement human review processes, especially for high-stakes moderation decisions.
- **Defense in Depth**: Use multiple layers of content detection (e.g., hashing for known bad content, AI for novel content, human review for edge cases) rather than relying on a single system.
- **Model Poisoning Risks**: Be aware that AI models can be manipulated through adversarial examples or poisoned training data. Regularly audit your models and their outputs.
- **Privacy Considerations**: Ensure that any AI model integration complies with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) and that user content is handled appropriately.

### User Input Sanitization

The components in this library accept user-provided inputs that are displayed to users:

- **Caption Text**: The `caption` prop can contain user-generated text that will be displayed on warning screens. If this text comes from untrusted sources (e.g., user input, external APIs), you should sanitize it to prevent the display of misleading or malicious messages. While React provides XSS protection by default, semantic attacks (displaying misleading information that appears to come from your application) are still possible.
- **Harm Type Labels**: The `harmType` prop is used to generate warning messages (e.g., "Possible {harmType}"). Ensure this value comes from a controlled set of labels in your application, not directly from user input or untrusted sources.
- **Length Limits**: Consider implementing maximum length limits for caption text to prevent UI abuse and ensure good user experience.

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

When using these filters with images and videos from external sources:

- **Validate Media Sources**: If loading media from user-provided URLs, validate that URLs come from trusted domains and implement appropriate CSP headers.
- **WebGL Context**: The reduced detail filter uses WebGL, which can be a target for certain types of attacks. Ensure WebGL is necessary for your use case and implement appropriate security measures.
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configure CORS headers when loading media from different origins to prevent unauthorized access.

### LocalStorage Security

The preference management system uses browser localStorage:

- **User-Controlled Data**: Remember that localStorage can be modified by users with browser developer tools. Do not store security-critical data in localStorage.
- **XSS Vulnerability**: If your application has XSS vulnerabilities, attackers can access localStorage data. Implement proper input sanitization and Content Security Policy to prevent XSS.
- **Per-Domain Storage**: localStorage is per-domain, so preferences are isolated between different domains but shared across all pages of the same domain.
